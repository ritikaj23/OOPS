# Travel Planner

## Introduction
This challenge will help you apply your knowledge of Java date manipulation by creating a travel planner application. As a developer for a travel agency, you'll build functionality that helps users plan their trips by:
1.	Calculating the duration of trips between departure and return dates
2.	Validating that travel dates are valid and logical
3.	Computing check-in and check-out dates based on arrival dates
4.	Determining if trips overlap with holidays or special events

This practical challenge reinforces key concepts from the date manipulation lab including:
- Using LocalDate, Period, and ChronoUnit for date operations
- Validating user input dates
- Calculating differences between dates
- Adding or subtracting time periods from dates
