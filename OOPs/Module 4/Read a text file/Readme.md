# Read a text file

## Introduction

In this challenge, you'll create a Java program that reads contact information from a text file and displays it in a formatted way. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of file I/O operations in Java, including:
- Opening and reading text files
- Using Java I/O packages effectively
- Handling exceptions that occur during file operations
- Processing and displaying file contents

You'll build a simple contact book application that reads contact information from a file, parses it, and presents it in a user-friendly format.

## Challenge Description
#### Create a Java program that:
1.	Prompts the user to enter the name of a contact file
2.	Reads the contact file which contains names and phone numbers
3.	Displays the contacts in a formatted way
4.	Handles any exceptions that might occur during file operations

#### The contact file format will be simple:
- Each line represents one contact
- Names and phone numbers are separated by a colon (:)
- Example: John Doe:+1-555-123-4567
